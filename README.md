# lol.js

## The only API you’ll ever need. Just returns 😂. That’s it.

## 🚀 The Problem

#### For decades, developers have struggled with complex APIs that return actual data. JSON responses, error handling, pagination—too much stress! Why? Do we really need that?

#### Imagine this:

-   Your backend crashes? Just return 😂.
-   Your database is down? Just return 😂.
-   You have no idea what’s going on? Just return 😂.
-   Your startup just got acquired? Flex by returning 😂.

#### That’s why we built lol.js, a game-changing package that always returns 😂.

## 🔥 Features

-   ✅ 99.9999% uptime (because nothing ever changes)
-   ✅ Zero configuration (because there is nothing to configure)
-   ✅ Lightning-fast responses (because it’s just one emoji)
-   ✅ Enterprise-ready (if your enterprise is completely unserious)
-   ✅ Serverless, Cloud-native, AI-powered, Blockchain-ready (buzzwords are free)

## 📌 How It Works

### 1️⃣ Install

```bash
  npm i @sagar_shetty/lol.js
```

### 2️⃣ Use in Your Project

```bash
  const lol = require('@sagar_shetty/lol.js');

  console.log(lol());
  // Output: 😂
```

## 🙌 Who Is This For?

-   ✅ Startups – Need a placeholder API while you figure things out? Use 😂.
-   ✅ Developers – Tired of debugging? Just replace all responses with 😂.
-   ✅ Enterprises – When your quarterly reports look bad, return 😂.
-   ✅ AI Engineers – Your AI model doesn’t work? Just return 😂 and call it "reinforcement learning."
-   ✅ Government Websites – Works perfectly when users ask for real information.
